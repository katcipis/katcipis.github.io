# Mocks: to write or not to write

Advantages:

* More high level and more specific error messages
* More control over behaviour, generic stuff tends to bite (my previous post)
* Less dependencies
* Favors Fakes instead of Mocks

Disadvantages:

* More work/time spent ? (not that much really)
* Space to bugs (the libs you use don't have bugs ?)
