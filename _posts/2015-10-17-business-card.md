title: My nerd business card
---

Participating in nerd events about linux and development is something I enjoy.
When I was living in Brazil I used to participate more frequently and I even
gave a few talks with my friend Natel.

I went to a Gopher Conference in London this year, it was really interesting,
much was spoken about Docker and of course go language. In the event I spoke
with a few people, however I didn't have a business card to give to them.

This week I was thinking about my first business card, it was a program written in C language, like this:

Front:

```
$ gcc -o benatto benatto.c 
$ ./benatto
segmentation fault
```

Back:

```c
int main() {
    char *name = "Paulo Leonardo Benatto";
    char *email = "benatto@gmail.com";
    char *phone = "XXXXXXXX";
    char *github = "github.com/patito";
    return 0;
}
```

Now I did another business card, this time in `python`.

If you are also a coder and would like a business card that makes you look weird, you can use this idea. :D
