      <description>Learning and programming in Go has been delightful 99% of the time, This makes even more remarkable when the language bites you in the ass :-). Actually it is a mix of my own ignorance + some other details, but for everyone that I presented this situation it did not seem like something obvious and intuitive.
A few weeks ago I have watched the Understanding Nil presentation, it is great way to really understand what nil is in Go, and I had no idea nil could behave as explained on the presentation.</description>

      <description>For me it makes no sense to talk about why a decision has been made without any context. So I will try to give some context on what was happening when we decided to give Go a shot.
We started to work at Neoway with the Go language for a year and a half right now, and on this post I will try to pass on some of the experience of learning Go.</description>
