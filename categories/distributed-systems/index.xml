      <description>The RESTless struggle for RESTfulness This post will be about my history trying to understand REST and RESTfulness (whatever that is, spoiler alert, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to define what it is), what worked for me and what sidetracked me.
As I evolve my ideas do not confuse that with me being sure of anything, I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure of shit until now, the only thing I&amp;rsquo;m sure is that repeating the same mistakes is not a good idea, but how to make new ones is another history.</description>
